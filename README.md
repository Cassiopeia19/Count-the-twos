# Count-the-twos
The challenge:  given one parameter, i.e. 23, from zero to 23, how many twos? (**I have modified this considerably.**)
In my modifications, I wanted to show that I could:  
1) generate an ordered, random, and with no repeats array--with both positive and negative integers
2) expand the range of numbers that could be possibly chosen
3) convert a treeset to an int array, thus allowing for the method (countTwos) to check for how many twos occur within the array
